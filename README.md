# Week Number Extension

Do you find people who just have to use week numbers annoying? Week number extension by FerieCountdown is your tool for understanding their language.

Week number extension is the handy tool that gives you the current week number in an instant!


## Installation

The extension is currently not on the Chrome Web Store as I currently do not feel like paying $25 to put it there. You must install it manually.

1. Navigate to /Build and download "Chrome.crx". 
2. Open chrome and go to "chrome://extensions".
3. Enable developer mode using the switch in the top right corner.
4. Drag and drop the file into the page, and click the "Add extension"-button.
5. You are ready to go!
